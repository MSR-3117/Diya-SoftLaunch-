# Environment Configuration Guide

This guide helps you set up the Brand Content Studio with proper API keys and configuration.

## File Structure

Create a `.env` file in the project root (`brand_content_studio/`) with the following variables:

```
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
BRANDFETCH_API_KEY=your-brandfetch-api-key
```

## Getting API Keys

### 1. Anthropic API Key (Required for AI Content)

1. Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to "API Keys"
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy and paste in `.env` file

**Cost**: $0.80 per 1M input tokens, $2.40 per 1M output tokens

### 2. BrandFetch API Key (Optional for Brand Assets)

1. Go to [BrandFetch Developers](https://brandfetch.com/developers)
2. Sign up for free tier
3. Create API key
4. Copy and paste in `.env` file

**Note**: The app works without this - manual brand entry will be used as fallback

### 3. Flask Secret Key

Generate a secure key:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Copy the output to `SECRET_KEY` in `.env`

## Environment Modes

- `development`: Debug mode enabled, auto-reload
- `production`: Debug mode disabled, optimized performance

## Troubleshooting API Setup

**API not working?**
- Check `.env` file is in correct location (project root)
- Verify keys are not expired
- Check API account has credits/quota
- Look at browser console for error messages

**Want to test without APIs?**
- Remove API keys from `.env`
- App will use fallback content generation
- Manual brand entry will still work
